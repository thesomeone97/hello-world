# hello-world
Little repository intended for me to learn the ropes of GitHub.

Hi there. My name is Thiago Rippel and I want to be a software developer. :) I currently know Python (just from uni), but want to learn Java and C++.
I study Engineering Mathematics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), which I just started in 2020 (although I'm certainly not new to uni), right around the
same time that the Covid-19 pandemic started unfortunately, which means that the classes I watched all year long have been online.
I also like videogames, mostly retro (NES, SNES, PSX, etc.).
